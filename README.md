# Basic Foundation v1.0

## Ideal For
1. Developers looking for the necessities to kickstart a responsive website, but without the bloat that comes with purchased templates and the libraries and many UI elements that are never used or needed.
2. Static websites developed heavily in HTML and CSS, with JS used rarely, and in its simplest form.

## NOT Ideal For
1. Dynamic web apps developed extensively with frameworks like ReactJS, VueJS, AngularJS, etc. These require various middleware and NodeJS dependencies that are not included in Basic Foundation, and benefit from a different project structure than a static site.
2. Language-specific plugin developers (i.e. WordPress PHP plugins). Plugins typically require a very specific project structure than a typical static site in order to function properly. You can find examples of those by searching for the plugin boilerplate online (i.e. 'WordPress plugin boilerplate').
3. Mobile app developers. You're definitely in the wrong place...

## Includes
1. Core project structure with base sample files
2. Required HTML elements in 'index.html' and 'html/about.html' with proper file paths
3. Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome libraries
4. jQuery
5. Base CSS elements
6. CSS Shortcodes in 'css/shortcodes.css'

## Languages and Libraries
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap 4 (most popular CSS framework for making a site responsive on all devices)
4. JavaScript (the js directory and 'js/app.js' file are included per convention. But they are not used in basic HTML file examples, and are not required components. Those not yet familiar with JavaScript can still fully design and develop a modern, responsive site with this foundation)
5. jQuery (most common JavaScript library. No jQuery experience is required. But many elements used in frameworks like Bootstrap are dependant on jQuery being in the project in order to function)
6. FontAwesome (largest and most popular icon library for easily adding icons for social media buttons, or the many other icons that can enhance the aesthetic of your site, while keeping the project size small and page load times quick)
